# Reflections:

The goal of this project was to make a game using canvas. I opted for the well-known and simple mobile game Flappy Bird. The goal of this game is to control the bird in such a way that it does not hit the wall and fly through the hole, which is random generated. The project allowed me to dig deeper into javascript and Typescript.
